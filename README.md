# BTW Mob Additions

## Quick Start

* Clone this repository
* Acquire the full BTW sources and put them under `src/btw/java` 
* (Optional) Put the BTW resources (textures, etc.) under `src/btw/resources`
* Run the gradle task *btwJar*
* Run the gradle task *build* and then *runClient*
* (Optional) Put the vanilla MC resources (sounds) under `run/resources`

## BTW Source Code

To get access to the Better Than Wolves source code, please refer to the [BTW-Gradle repository](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-gradle)
 or (alternatively) the [BTW-Public repository](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-Public), which also offers a way to generate the sources.

## Releasing Mods/Addons

Drop on by the discord server if you need help: [BTW Discord](https://discord.gg/fhMK5kx). 

The mod file for the release is generated by the Gradle task *remapJar* and then put into `release`.

After successfully importing the MultiMC instance, you can put your mod file into the mods folder of your installation. 
If it is a coremod, put it into coremods.

## Issues & Troubleshooting

* How do I obtain the BTW-sources? *Please refer to [BTW-Gradle](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-gradle) or [BTW-Public](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-Public).* 

More troubleshooting is still todo. Feel free to message me on Discord.
